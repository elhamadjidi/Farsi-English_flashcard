# Farsi-English_flashcard
In this flashcard, we used 5000 most common Farsi words from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Persian.
The list is extracted and transferred to a CSV file. For each card, the Farsi word is on the front and, the equivalent English word is on the back of the card. 
Each word is randomly chosen from the list the translation is shown after 3*seconds. there are two buttons under each word, if the user knows the word they choose âœ” otherwise they choose X. The word that the user knows will not be shown again until after all words are shown and remembered.

*The user can change this in the main code if they need more time.
